# filemanip-extra
Collected add-on IO functions based on ListLIke and filemanip

I just dumped all the modules here that I could find dealing with files,
filenames, and other basic IO operations.  Hopefully we can try
to avoid reinventing these functions in the future.  The module names
are bogus  - System.FilePath.Extra* - thought should be given to what
these should be.  A test suite would be great too.
